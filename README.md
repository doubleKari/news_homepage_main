Frontend project

This frontend project is bootstrapped with React using vite. 
I make use TailwindCSS framework for designing the the page as well as it's layout.
In this project, I apply the React concept, state management using react useState hook, whihc I use in building the side menu
that opens and closes on clicking the humberger menu and close button respection.
